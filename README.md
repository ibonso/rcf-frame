# rcf-frame
Remote control frame
----------------------
Main goal is to create a light framework tha will enable to control through https, 
in a secure way (user access control) a very simple car. The car will be controlled by a beaglebone or similar soc.
I will try dependencies to minimal. C++, kfgi, sqlite, rapidjson and html javascript for client.

Anyway the framework has to be usefull for any other environment where a light html - http - C framework is needed.

By now, code is being developed and tested in Xubuntu, debian and beaglebone blue.
